# Project Build & Test Instructions

This file contains instructions for building and testing the project. Ralph reads this file at the start of each iteration and updates it with learnings.

## How to Build

Add your build commands here. Examples:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Or:

```bash
make build
```

Or:

```bash
# No build step required
```

## How to Test

Add your test commands here. Examples:

```bash
npm test
```

Or:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Or:

```bash
make test
```

Or:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

## Learnings

**For Ralph:** Add learnings here as you discover patterns, gotchas, or useful context during iterations.

Examples of good learnings:
- When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync
- Tests require the dev server running on port 3000
- Use `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` for development
- The database must be migrated before tests: `npm run migrate`

**Current learnings:**

(Ralph will add learnings here as work progresses)
