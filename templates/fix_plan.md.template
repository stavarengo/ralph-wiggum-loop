# Fix Plan

This file tracks the tasks Ralph needs to complete. Ralph updates this file after each iteration.

## Instructions

**For Ralph:**
- Work on tasks in order from top to bottom (most important first)
- After completing a task, move it from "Tasks" to "Completed" with a checkmark
- If blocked, move the task to "Blocked/Issues" with a description
- When all tasks are complete, write `RALPH_COMPLETE` at the top of this file
- Keep this file updated after every iteration

**Priority:** Tasks are ordered by importance. Complete them in the order listed.
